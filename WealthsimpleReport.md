***Wealthsimple*** is a Canadian online investment management service and was incorporated on September 23, 2014. It was founded by **Michael Katchen**

Katchen worked for *1000Memories*, a Silicon Valley-based startup. After *Ancestry.com* bought the company in 2012, Katchen developed a spreadsheet with tips to help his colleagues set up private investments. Interest in the spreadsheet helped inspire the idea for Wealthsimple.

Wealthsimple makes money via management fees, currency conversion fees, operations fees, additional services, interest on cash, as well as interchange fees. They've raised <span style= 'color: lime;'> $1.1b (CA) </span>  as of May 2021.

## Business Activities:

Wealthsimple's business model is centered around financial literacy and long-term wealth management using consistent, AI-driven and expert-backed insights to each user on a deeply personalized level. With multiple account types, investment options and wealth building tools, they give their users control of how they interact with their finances.

Weathsimple's target market is described as *"the next generation of investors"* but that doesnt just mean anybody with a smart phone looking to make a quick buck. With their ecosystem of tools, resources and data they are cultivating a financially literate customer base that is focused on long-term wealth growth which supports their business model by allowing them to hold on to funds for longer periods of time much like banks. 


By combining multiple cutting-edge technologies, Wealthsimple has quickly established itself as a dominant player in the market. Their pioneering auto investment technology serves as the cornerstone of their success. Here's how it works: customers deposit funds into a personal account and specify their investment preferences in terms of aggressiveness. From there, Wealthsimple takes the reins, leveraging predictive AI calculations based on user preferences and market trends. This results in intelligent investments at scale, all optimized for growth. Notably, users are not privy to the specific investments being made, showcasing the hands-off nature of the process. Wealthsimple's success in this endeavor hinges on its ability to harness vast amounts of data. To achieve this, the company must access, organize, and analyze copious data resources. This infrastructure supports their swift decision-making, ensuring that funds are made available to users promptly when required.

Additionally, Wealthsimple offers an investment portfolio manager, enabling financially savvy users to directly engage in buying and trading stocks and cryptocurrencies. Catering to their target audience of financially literate individuals, this feature provides autonomy and control over investment choices.

Furthermore, Wealthsimple's data-driven approach extends to its meticulous management of millions of transactions annually. Each account and its associated assets are digitally recorded, contributing valuable insights to their automated trading model. The company's privacy policy acknowledges the collection and utilization of transaction data for various purposes, including account management, reporting, tax documentation, and enhancing platform services.

To bolster financial literacy and alleviate user anxieties related to investment, Wealthsimple introduced SimpleTax, another component of their ecosystem. This tool streamlines the tax reporting process, particularly valuable for users lacking the expertise to navigate tax complexities. Through automation, Wealthsimple minimizes barriers to productivity, while also acting as a pseudo-tax advisor by guiding users towards eligible deductions and credits.

Diving into Wealthsimple's round-up feature, this innovation monitors users' bank account activities, rounding up each purchase to the nearest dollar. The remaining cents are directed into the user's bank account, with the necessary permissions to facilitate automatic withdrawals. This straightforward yet effective tool contributes to a comprehensive financial ecosystem, enabling users to feel at ease depositing substantial sums and incurring transaction and conversion fees for debit payments.

Lastly, Wealthsimple Cash functions as a checking account complete with a debit card. The inclusion of this feature within the broader ecosystem encourages users to entrust more significant portions of their income to Wealthsimple. Like their manual investment facet, managing these transactions necessitates substantial data management capabilities encompassing storage, organization, and analysis.

In summary, Wealthsimple's ascendancy is a result of seamlessly combining cutting-edge technologies to offer a range of features. From their automated investment approach and user-managed portfolio manager to their simplified tax tool, round-up feature, and checking account, each aspect contributes to a holistic financial experience. The underpinning of these achievements is Wealthsimple's adept handling of massive datasets and resourceful utilization of AI-driven insights.

## Landscape:

Wealthsimple has taken over multiple domains. They are undoubtedly a wealth management company, an online banking institution, a capital investment tool/ manager as well as a blockchain asset manager and a roboadvisor. All this was necessary to tackle the competitors they were taking on; banks. Wealthsimples main competitors in the space are traditional Canadian Banks like RBC, CIBC, TD and BMO. With more and more wealthsimple users handing over larger portions of their pay and rounding up their transactions to increase their deposit rate, Wealthsimple is beginning to take a major hold on Canadian Private Equity (especially in the current recession that we're supposed to just pretend isnt happening?....sorry). 

While their competitors have been comparatively slow to take on new technologies and transition to the cutting edge over the past decade, Wealthsimple cut to the head of the line and it shows in the differences in pudding. Wealthsimple does not provide services like loans, credit or mortgages, one could argue that these services provide an important vehicle for economic and business growth, however data shows that most instances of credit, loans and mortgage are detrimental to long-term wealth of account holders. Wealthsimple circumvents the need for this by branding itself an asset manager instead of a bank. Cash, stocks, crypto and tax returns are all treated as assets to be stored and maintained, turning wealthsimple to what banks wish they were a secure storagehouse for users' long-term finances. The closest competitor Wealthsimple has when it comes to financial technology within Canada is Tangerine Bank a very modern banking solution but even they lack as robust an ecosystem.

While Wealthsimple is still only starting to compete in terms of the massive market share these established institutions have, their rate of growth is impressive and impactful as we enter a new age of digital technology.

## Recommendations

Like I mentioned before, Wealthsimple does not cover the loan, credit or advance markets and I believe that's a good idea because their wealth building brand means they shouldn't be associated with any kind of debt. However I would suggest going further in the opposite direction. Debt management is an industry that's lacking the cutting-edge, big data resources that other fintech domains already have. Increasing credit score, managing bills, budgeting and more could be applied to the current ecosystem to make wealthsimple the perfect gateway for abandoning traditional banking completetely. To make this happen Wealthsimple will utilize their massive data processing capabilities to build similar predictive models for debt as they do for investment. This model could identify things like amount owed, minimum payments required, ideal payment window, burn rate, how long till a user is out of money and more.
